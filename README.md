# Maypaper
The (upcoming) dynamic wallpaper tool!

## Introduction
Maypaper is a tool which allows you to put a webpage (ideally locally installed, or remote) as your wallpaper, using webkitgtk. It comes with accompanying tools to manage the installation and updates of wallpapers, although these are entirely optional.

## Usage
Maypaper includes 3 binaries, `maypaper`, `mypctl` and `myppm`.

### maypaper
`maypaper` is the main binary, which runs the wallpaper program. Run `maypaper --help` to get a list of all arguments. `maypaper` is configured purely over IPC, or by arguments and has no direct configuration file.

### mypctl
`mypctl` is the control tool for maypaper, that communicates with it over IPC. Run `mypctl --help` to get a list of all arguments.

### myppm
`myppm` is the package manager for maypaper, in the sense that it manages wallpapers for you. It does a partial clones of git repositories (you specify the folders you want), and keeps them updated. Run `myppm --help` to get a list of all arguments. Upon the first run of `myppm`, a configuration directory will be created at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/maypaper`, where a file called `wallpapers.toml` will exist. Within there, you can specify the wallpapers you wish to be declaratively managed by `myppm`.

## Getting Wallpapers
You can make your own repository for wallpapers, use someone else's.
Alternatively, here exists a repository under I manage: [Maywalls](https://github.com/initMayday/maywalls).
Just to reinforce, it is completely decentralised, `myppm` makes no assumptions about what repository you are using.
