## Introduction
Maypaper is a tool which allows you to put a webpage (ideally locally installed, or remote) as your wallpaper, using QT's webengine (chromium). If local, it automatically starts a webserver to serve that page, and spins it down as required.

## Usage
Maypaper includes 3 binaries, `maypaper`, `mypctl` and `myptmp`.  
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Mayware/maypaper/wiki/mypctl), to see how to use the program

### maypaper
`maypaper` is the main binary, which runs the wallpaper program. Run `maypaper --help` to get a list of all arguments. `maypaper` is configured purely over IPC, or by arguments and has no direct configuration file.

### mypctl
`mypctl` is the control tool for maypaper, that communicates with it over IPC. Run `mypctl --help` to get a list of all arguments.

### mytmp
`myptmp` generates local websites for you, based on templates and arguments you give it. Run `myptmp --help` to get a list of all arguments.
